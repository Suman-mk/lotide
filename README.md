Lotide Functional Requirements - Checklist
Make Lotide Directory	Organize code inside a git repository.
Implement Assert Equal	Write a function that takes in 2 values and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise.
Improve Assert Equal	Write an updated Assert Equal Function that uses template literals.
Implement Head	Write a function that takes in an array and returns the first element in the array.
Implement Tail	Write a function that takes in an array and returns everything except the first element of the array.
Implement eqArrays	Write a function that takes in 2 arrays and returns true if the arrays are equal and false otherwise.
Implement assertArraysEqual	Write a function that takes in 2 arrays and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise.
Implement without	Write a function that takes in a source array and an itemsToRemove arrays and returns only the items from the source array that are not in the itemsToRemove array.
Implement flatten	Write a function that takes in an array that contains elements including nested array of elements and returns a flattened version of the array.
Implement middle	Write a function that takes in an array and returns middle most element of the array.
Implement countOnly in Lotide	Write a function that takes in a collection of items and returns a specific subset of those items.
Implement countLetters in Lotide	Write a function that takes in a sentence and returns a count of each of the letters in the sentence.
Implement letterPositions	Write a function that takes in a string and returns all indices of letter positions in the string.
Implement findKeyByValue in Lotide	Write a function that takes in an object and a value and returns the first key that corresponds to that value.
Implement eqObjects	Write a function that takes in 2 objects and return true if they are equal and false otherwise.
Implement assertObjectsEqual	Write a function that takes in 2 objects and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise.
Implement Map	Write a function that takes in an array and a callback and returns a new array based on the results of the callback on each item in the array.
Implement takeUntil	Write a function that takes in an array and callback and returns a slice of the array based on the criteria specified in the callback.
Implement findKey	Write a function that takes in an object and callback and returns the first key that meets the criteria specified in callback.
Recursive eqObjects	Write a refactored eqObjects function that uses recursion.
Recursive eqArrays	Write a refactored eqArrays function that uses recursion.
Lotide Refactor Example	Modularize assertEqual Function.
Refactor Tail	Modularize tail function.
Refactor eqArrays	Modularise eqArrays function.
Refactor assertArraysEqual	Modularise assertArraysEqual function.
Refactor middle	Modularise middle function.
Incorporate Mocha and Chai	Set up correctly for testing with Mocha and Chai.
Refactor with Mocha and Chai I	Write tests for tail and middle functions using Mocha and Chai.
Exporting All Functions II	Create an index.js file that exports all the functions in Lotide as an object.
Implement Object Shorthand	Apply the new, shorter, property value shorthand syntax from ES6 to the main object being created and exported in the index.js file.
Publishing Lotide To npm	Publish lotide library to npm.
Submitting Lotide	Review requirements checklist and submit project for evaluation following LHL guidelines.
More Lotide Cleanup	Write tests using Mocha and Chai for the rest of the functions (flatten, countonly, letterPositions, findKeyByValue, eqObjects, eqArrays).
